# bendRL: Visual Reaching and tracking

In this work, we evaluate the ability to learn image-based reaching and tracking asks via reinforcement learning on the UR10e robotic arm by Universal Robots


## Objective

This work explores the potential of on- and off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms to perform image-based reaching and tracking tasks. In order to guage performance in a realistic manner, the physical training environment contains variable light conditions and numerous objects and colours that may distract the agent. All training is performed end-to-end and online.
